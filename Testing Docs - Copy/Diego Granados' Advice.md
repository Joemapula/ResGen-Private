Asking questions helps you understand the context and encourages your team to reaffirm or rethink their goals.

Questions like "Why are we building X?" can uncover cases where the team lacks clarity about their objectives.

As a new PM, it's easy to feel like you must say "yes" to everything that comes your way.

However, your job as a Product Manager is to ruthlessly prioritize tasks so you and your team know exactly what to build, why, and how to do it efficiently.

As a PM, it's essential to influence without authority. This is achieved by understanding the context around you and actively listening to customers, teams, and stakeholders.

So, pay attention and let their insights guide your decisions.

Experience your product as a first-time user, even if it's something technical like APIs. Break it apart, find bugs, and document everything you see.

Revisiting these notes later will help you maintain a fresh perspective on the user experience.

üìù TL;DR Summary:

‚úÖ Learn to say No

‚úÖ Aim for small wins first

‚úÖ Prioritize Relationships

‚úÖ Listen more, speak less

‚úÖ Break your own product

‚úÖ Get your hands on the data

‚úÖ Always ask questions, especially "Why?"

‚úÖ Be obsessed with understanding customer problems

# Project advice

1. Working on your own side project

Side projects are great ways to:

‚Üí Learn more about Product Management

‚Üí Learn whether you like being a PM

‚Üí Gain Skills & Exp for your resume

All side projects, like PMs, do on their job, follow similar steps:

‚úÖ Find problems to solve ‚Üí type "how to [your interest]" on Google & YouTube to see what problems people are trying to solve.

‚úÖ Validate the problem ‚Üí talk to friends and family about the problem. Is it really a problem worth solving? Gather data.

‚úÖ Design a Solution & Validate ‚Üí create a prototype on free software like Figma. Show your solution to the people you interviewed.

‚úÖ Develop a product ‚Üí use no-code tools like Zapier or ask engineer friends to help you build the product.

‚úÖ Launch it! ‚Üí From day 1, talk about it online. This will be your marketing and it'll cost you $0. Before launching invite users to sign-up and stay updated.

- Looked for problems they had or that existed around them
- Talked with users/customers
- Created a prototype and validated it
- Built an MVP (they created it, hired engineers or used no-code tools)
- Launched it using social media!

Building a side project is the best you can do to become a PM. However, it's a big task.

Start this week by finding a pain point around you:

‚Üí On social media type "How to" and see the autocomplete to find what people search for

‚Üí Use Reddit to find "hot" topics about an industry or product

‚Üí Ask "why?" 5 times when someone shares a struggle/problem.

# AI PM Transition advice

AI PM specific stuff

- he also has info about AI PM transitioning: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/diegogranadosh_how-can-you-transition-into-an-aiml-product-activity-7178782502633840641-QubD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/diegogranadosh_how-can-you-transition-into-an-aiml-product-activity-7178782502633840641-QubD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

How can you transition into an AI&ML Product Manager role with or without technical experience? 3 actionable ways üëá

Being an AI&ML Product Manager is much more than understanding how to create prompts for GenAI Models, or knowing that ML models create predictions. A big part of the job of an AI&ML PM job is to understand the data science lifecycle - from understanding where the data is sourced, how is it cleaned and treated, all the way to predictions, metrics, legal, and ethics.

Here are 3 things you can do that will give you skills and experience in machine learning üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Building a public portfolio on Kaggle

[Kaggle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kaggle/)

is a fantastic resource for learning and practicing Machine Learning. They offer free practical classes to learn the basics of Python programming and Machine Learning programming. They also have open competitions that you can use to practice your knowledge in ML.

Just like engineers have a public Github repository to share their projects and experience, you can share your public free Notebooks in Kaggle to show your experience with ML projects - this can go in your resume

Here's what you can do:

‚Üí Take their free classes to learn how to build ML models

‚Üí Participate in competitions (even if they expired) to practice

‚Üí After enough practice, find real problems around you and solve them like a Product Manager + AI. In other words, don't just throw numbers and a model into your notebook. Talk about users, interview them, share your hypothesis, build a prototype (ML prototype), etc.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Participate in AI&ML Hackathons

Here's one hackathon opportunity you cannot miss!

[Liam Bolling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liambolling/)

's team at Google (Gemini) is hosting a virtual Hackathon where you'll have the chance to win $50,000, you'll meet with the Gemini team and, the best part, you don't need to know how to code! (until May 3rd 2024)

Approach this hackathon like a PM would:

- What problem are you solving?
- Why are you solving this problem and why now?
- How can you solve this problem using Gemini, in a way that is better than the alternative?

Check my comment below for the details on how to enter this Hackathon!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Consider studying a Master's Program

Whether we like it or not, Master's degree >>>>>> Coursera certification (or other short-term certification).

There are many M.S. in Computer/Data science that will give you theoretical and experiential knowledge about models. These programs will also allow you to access their recruitment opportunities and meet recruiters who are looking for people experienced in AI&ML, including Product Managers.

Some programs are very affordable - I did an M.S.C.S. at Georgia Tech (virtual) and it was way more affordable than an MBA or most other programs.

One of the most common questions I receive is how to become an AI&ML Product Manager. Here's my advice, options, and projects to work on üëá

Creating prompts for ChatGPT doesn't make you an AI&ML PM.

AI&ML Product Managers don't need to code ML Models. In fact, the code for a Machine Learning algorithm is "easy" - it takes less than 5 lines of Python code to do it.

However, knowing what happens before and after those 5 lines + understanding the what, why, why now, for whom, and how to use AI&ML is what PMs in AI&ML are responsible for.

Here are a few things you can do If you want to become an AI&ML PM.

1Ô∏è‚É£ The basics of AI&ML

Kaggle has a fantastic free course to learn the basics of Python, handling data, and learning how to create your first few ML Models.

[https://lnkd.in/gHibxkSn](https://lnkd.in/gHibxkSn)

2Ô∏è‚É£ The theory of ML

Knowing how to code ML models is important to understand what Data Scientists do. However, knowing the theory behind ML Models helps you understand when & how models are used in different business problems.

This ML specialization on Coursera will give you a solid foundation on ML:

[https://lnkd.in/gjVvb9k2](https://lnkd.in/gjVvb9k2)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical experience

Theory is great, but nothing beats putting your knowledge into practice. Here are a few ideas:

‚Üí You can build a portfolio of projects in Kaggle (like Github)

‚Üí You can create a side project on your own using AI/ML (no, a prompt to Chat GPT is not a project)

‚Üí You can find a project at work where you can put into practice your AI/ML skills

‚Üí You can find non-profits or organizations around you and help them with a project... using AI&ML

4Ô∏è‚É£ Another option: A Master's degree

If you are serious about getting into AI&ML, I recommend exploring doing an M.S. in C.S. or D.S.

Why?

‚Üí There are not that many AI&ML PMs in the market

‚Üí Most AI&ML Job postings ask for an M.S. in C.S./D.S. and may be willing to trade the lack of AI&ML job experience for the studies.

Georgia Tech has an Online M.S.C.S. for <$10K

The one I'm finished last December ‚Üí

These are 4 things I would do to become (again) an AI & Machine Learning Product Manager, even if I had almost 0 technical experienceüëá

The 4 steps consist of:

‚Üí Learning the theory of Machine Learning

‚Üí Coding ML models in Python

‚Üí Showing skills you gained

‚Üí Building an ML Product

üìñ ùêãùêûùêöùê´ùêßùê¢ùêßùê† ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê®ùê´ùê≤ ùê®ùêü ùêåùêöùêúùê°ùê¢ùêßùêû ùêãùêûùêöùê´ùêßùê¢ùêßùê†

Machine Learning covers way more than feeding prompts to ChatGPT. AI&ML Product Managers don't just focus on LLM prompts, or on choosing which model works best for a problem - that's what Data Scientists will do.

However, understanding how models work and how to evaluate them can help you make critical decisions:

- Go/No-Go decisions
- New data you need to find
- Which data you should never use
- Which data is sensitive and should be used with caution

‚≠êÔ∏è A good introduction course to machine learning:

[https://lnkd.in/gTSTXDk](https://lnkd.in/gTSTXDk)

üíª ùêÇùê®ùêùùê¢ùêßùê† ùêåùêã ùê¶ùê®ùêùùêûùê•ùê¨ ùê¢ùêß ùêèùê≤ùê≠ùê°ùê®ùêß

Another benefit of studying the theory is realizing whether AI&ML is for you and something you'll enjoy doing.

The next step is to learn how to code ML models.

Why? Because coding an ML model takes you ~2 lines of code...

However, understanding everything Data Scientists go through will help you understand that ML is more than 2 lines of code.

At a high level, Data scientists have to:

- Get the data
- Clean the data
- Define experiments
- Train models & evaluate
- Tune models and understand metrics

AI&ML PMs need to understand this process to help their team with roadblocks, building roadmaps, and designing solutions to solve customer problems.

‚≠êÔ∏è My favorite free step-by-step tutorial for learning about code and ML in Python:

[https://lnkd.in/gHibxkSn](https://lnkd.in/gHibxkSn)

üèÜ ùêíùê°ùê®ùê∞ùê¢ùêßùê† ùê¨ùê§ùê¢ùê•ùê•ùê¨ ùê≤ùê®ùêÆ ùê†ùêöùê¢ùêßùêûùêù

Learning how to code ML models is a great first step, but now you need to show that you understand how ML models solve business problems.

This is a fantastic way to show the world you can be an AI&ML PM!

Kaggle also handles competitions and opportunities for showing a public 'notebook' where you can go from analyzing the business to providing a solution/prediction. This can be a public profile that helps you showcase your skills in your resume/LinkedIn.

‚≠êÔ∏è Here's an example of what a public notebook looks like:

[https://lnkd.in/gqhGJb_G](https://lnkd.in/gqhGJb_G)

üöÄ ùêÅùêÆùê¢ùê•ùêùùê¢ùêßùê† ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùêåùêã ùêèùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠

The last step to show you can be a great AI&ML is to build your own product!

Now that you learned about the theory of ML and how to code, nothing stops you from building a solution to a problem around you.

Building an AI&ML product is one of the best ways to become an AI&ML PM. All you need is:

- Find a Problem to solve
- Talk to users (validate)
- Prototype (using AI&ML)
- Test (show it to users)
- Build the solution
- Launch!

Being a PM in AI&ML is more than just knowing how to pass a good prompt to ChatGPT. It's about understanding the Data Science Life Cycle and understanding the what, why, why now, for whom, and how to use AI&ML.

# General Job search

Landing a Product Manager job takes more than JUST rewriting your resume or turning on

[hashtag#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=opentowork&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7197252754107424769)

(turn it on, it does help!)

These are 5 things that I told people I‚Äôve mentored - regardless of their years of experience or industry expertise (or students!)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Find your Niche

I talk with a lot of people who share their aspirations ‚ÄúI want to be a product manager at Microsoft (or any company)‚Äù

When I ask them these questions, 99% of them don‚Äôt have an answer:

- Which part of Microsoft? Azure? Xbox? Office? Etc‚Ä¶
- Within that group, what kind of PM? AI? Growth? Platform? Technical? B2B/B2C?

The more you can narrow down your experience and find your niche, the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù (or at least faster) you‚Äôll find your next role.

‚≠êÔ∏è Find your niche by matching your experience with:

- B2B vs B2C
- Industry (e.g., healthcare, developer experiences)
- Technology (e.g., APIs, AI)
- Internal vs External products

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tailor everything

Resume? Tailor it

LinkedIn? Tailor it

Reaching out to someone? Tailor it

Practicing for interviews? Tailor it

Tailoring your resume (and everything) means that you should use the job description as a guide. For example, if the job description is for a technical/platform PM job:

‚ùå Developed the strategy and roadmap for a Notification Center - is not a tailored accomplishment

‚úÖ Developed the strategy and roadmap for a Notification Center by collecting user feedback on API usage, and experience with platform Latency - add keywords from job description IN CONTEXT with your accomplishments.

‚≠êÔ∏è After you tailor everything, turn on

[hashtag#OpenToWork](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=opentowork&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7197252754107424769)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Have a plan A, B, C and D

Plan A: your dream jobs

Plan B: jobs you are a great fit for in an industry you want

Plan C: Plan B + industry from your experience

Plan D: adjacent roles

‚≠êÔ∏è Execute these plans in parallel, but be precise about your strategy

4Ô∏è‚É£ Doing a project >>>>> certifications

Doing a certification (in whatever you want, including PM) leaves your resume exactly the same‚Ä¶ with one more line about the certification

Spend more time thinking about building side projects/products than doing ‚Äúone more certification‚Äù

‚≠êÔ∏èBuilding Products also helps aspiring PMs much more than any other method

5Ô∏è‚É£ Networking is vital

It‚Äôs important to know how to do better networking than: ‚Äúcan you please refer me?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how‚Ä¶ Networking with:

- Employees: approach them from a learning perspective. You want to learn about them, their experience, their role and you seek advice. Don‚Äôt ask for referral right away.
- Recruiters and Hiring Managers: find them on the company page. Send them a message that includes which roles you applied to, WHY you are a GREAT fit and asking them to pass your profile to the right team

# Resume

üü¢ ùêåùêöùê§ùêû ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùê´ùêûùê¨ùêÆùê¶ùêû ùê´ùêûùê•ùêûùêØùêöùêßùê≠

The 3 most essential things to understand about your resume:

- Your Resume is built for recruiters and hiring managers, not for you.
- Write accomplishments, not job descriptions. Use the X-Y-Z formula "ùòàùò§ùò§ùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò≠ùò™ùò¥ùò©ùò¶ùò• [ùòü] ùò¢ùò¥ ùòÆùò¶ùò¢ùò¥ùò∂ùò≥ùò¶ùò• ùò£ùò∫ [ùò†], ùò£ùò∫ ùò•ùò∞ùò™ùòØùò® [ùò°]"
- Tailor it.. make it Relevant. Write keywords and accomplishments ùóøùó≤ùóπùó≤ùòÉùóÆùóªùòÅ to the job you are applying to.

This is the resume I used to get my job at Microsoft in 2019.

This is the resume I used to land a job at Microsoft. It's definitely not perfect and I've improved it since then, but here are a few things that helped me in the process and I'll show them using colors üëá

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aba72b53-a6ac-42bf-84e1-5ab3e2610f2c/77e56b41-fafc-4793-ada8-701e969f56cf/image.png)

While it's certainly not perfect, there are a few things that helped me in the process and I'll show them to you, using colors üëá

[1] Format

Don't worry about searching for fancy, colorful, complex templates. A black&white plain old boring template works.

Recruiters & hiring managers care about your accomplishments and about you, not about the colors you chose for your resume (unless you are a designer or something similar).

[2] Write accomplishments with X-Y-Z

Most of my accomplishments written using as a base the X-Y-Z formula (shared by Google recruiters)

"Accomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"

Follow it as close as possible, but don't be afraid to put your own style into it (as long as you share your X,Y & Z)

[3] Use strong verbs (red üî¥)

Start every accomplishment with a verb in past tense.

- Strong Verbs (Led) >>>> Soft Verbs (Assisted)
- Try to use verbs relevant to the role. For PM I used: Led, Designed, Researched, Prioritized, etc.

[4] Relevant Skills (blue üîµ)

Notice how I don't have a "skills section" full of Product Manager keywords like "cross-functional", "leadership", "prioritization", "Roadmap"?

The keywords in blue are embedded in my accomplishments. I'm showing the context of how I used those skills to help customers, my team, and/or the organization.

I took these keywords from job descriptions I wanted to apply to.

[5] Show your impact (yellow üü°)

Not every accomplishment has to have impact, but try to add as many as you can. Impact shows that:

- You can do the job
- You can do it well
- You can make a difference

Anyone can "complete a project in time", but not everyone can "complete a project in time by doing xxxxx, and having an impact of yyyyy"

If you struggle to find the impact, think about this:

- What is it that without YOU it wouldn't have been possible? What did it cause (impact)? How did you measure what happened?

[6] Technical Skills (green üü¢)

I write down all the technical skills that I know and can show some 'proof' (a test, a score, etc.). Many of these are taken from the job descriptions I was applying to.

A few things to remember:

- 'sprinkle' tech(hard) skills here and there
- don't throw all of them in a giant skills section
- don't have üü¢ > üîµ (unless you go for Software Engineer roles)

[7] Other stuff to keep in mind

Length? 1, 2, 3 pages are ok. You may have a lot of experience. Make it RELEVANT, that's what matters.

Tailoring your resume to the job >>>> almost everything else.

Don't submit the same resume to every job.

Triple-check for grammar/spelling mistakes.

BONUS: While I worked on my resume for a while (and there's still A LOT of room for improvement), what got me my recent jobs was the fact that I networked a lot.

Don't underestimate the power of networking.

‚úåÔ∏è Hope this helps!

This is what I do if I had to apply for a Product Manager job like this one. 3 things I do to stand out in my applications üëá

The most important thing about your job applications is that your resume and LinkedIn are not for you. It is to help recruiters and hiring managers see that you have the experience and skills they need.

üîµ Relevant accomplishments on your resume >> Anything else

Every job description has "Required" qualifications. This is EXACTLY what hiring managers are looking for and you should prioritize writing accomplishments related to, ideally, every single one of them.

Adding keywords in a skills section is not enough. Saying that you have skills in "Leadership", or "Roadmap" without context is meaningless.

Instead, use the X-Y-Z formula: "Accomplished [X], as Measured by [Y] by doing [Z]" to show that I have the experience they need.

For example:

"Increased the usage of [feature] by n%, by leading a team of engineers and designers to develop, A/B test, and launch a new user onboarding flow."

In a single sentence, I mix multiple concepts and PM keywords that I find in the job description:

‚Üí Launching

‚Üí Leadership

‚Üí A/B testing

‚Üí Developing a feature

‚Üí Working cross-functionally

The more tailored your resume to the job description, the higher your chances of getting a call for an interview.

üü† Required Qualifications >> Preferred Qualifications >> Everything else

Have you applied to a job that has REQUIRED 2+ years of experience in PM but you don't have any and wonder why you didn't get a call for an interview?

Yes, not meeting the required/basic qualifications may be a strong reason to not get an interview.

When you tailor your resume to a job description, make sure that you are prioritizing in this order:

1 ‚Üí Basic / Required qualifications

2 ‚Üí Preferred qualifications

3 ‚Üí Responsibilities

4 ‚Üí Anything else

Showing that you have the required qualifications in the form of accomplishments on your resume should be your top priority!

üü¢ Tailoring for every job can be exhausting, here's a different approach

Tailoring your resume is not easy and can quickly become overwhelming. I divide my experience into types of PM jobs for which I can be a good fit.

For example, I may want a marketplace 0 to 1 job... but I don't have that experience so it'll be hard to tailor my resume to that. So, I focus on my strengths:

‚Üí AI/ML for either consumer or Enterprise

‚Üí Consumer Growth

‚Üí B2B Platforms (a bit of a stretch)

Instead of tailoring my resume to every job I apply for, I create one resume for AI&ML, a second one for Consumer Growth, and a third one for B2B Platform.

üöÄ Networking, networking, networking

Needless to say, I don't rely only on applying for a job. I spend as much time networking with recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn.

I focus on a key message:

‚Üí Why am I reaching out

‚Üí Which job did I apply to

‚Üí Why am I a good fit

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aba72b53-a6ac-42bf-84e1-5ab3e2610f2c/c4bde891-d2b5-4500-b2ca-d366bd89e235/image.png)

This is one of the most important things I‚Äôve learned about resumes, and most don‚Äôt do it. Not doing this can hurt your chances of getting an interview üëá

Your resume ùê¨ùê°ùê®ùêÆùê•ùêù ùêßùê®ùê≠ ùêõùêû a description of what you are ùê´ùêûùê¨ùê©ùê®ùêßùê¨ùê¢ùêõùê•ùêû for.

Your resume ùê¨ùê°ùê®ùêÆùê•ùêù ùêõùêû a collection of your ùêöùêúùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ùê¨ ùê´ùêûùê•ùêûùêØùêöùêßùê≠ to the job you are applying for!

Here's a simple example:

A Project Manager's resume that describes what they are ùê´ùêûùê¨ùê©ùê®ùêßùê¨ùê¢ùêõùê•ùêû for looks like this:

- Delivered the project on time and within budget.
- Communicated updates regularly to all stakeholders.

This is a terrible way to "stand out" - In this example, every Project Manager is responsible for delivering projects on time and budget, and for communicating with stakeholders. In other words, there's nothing ùêÆùêßùê¢ùê™ùêÆùêû about this person's resume.

Your resume has to show:

- Evidence that you have the experience they are looking for (Tailored resume)
- Evidence of the value you bring to the team (Your past accomplishments)

To write a resume that ùê¨ùê≠ùêöùêßùêùùê¨ ùê®ùêÆùê≠, here‚Äôs what you should do üëá

Write ùêöùêúùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ùê¨, not what you were responsible for :

- What did you do?
- What was the impact?
- How did you accomplish it?

Use the ‚Äúùêó + ùêò + ùêô‚Äù formula to write accomplishments:

‚ÄúAccomplished [ùêó] as measured by [ùêò], by doing [ùêô]‚Äù

üõë Instead of writing: ‚ÄúDelivered a project on time and budget‚Äù

‚úÖ Write this:

ùêÄùêúùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùêûùêù [ùêó]: ‚ÄúLaunched ____ project‚Äù

ùêåùêûùêöùê¨ùêÆùê´ùêûùêù ùêõùê≤ [ùêò]: ‚Äú1 month ahead of schedule and increasing ROI by Z%‚Äù

ùêÅùê≤ ùêùùê®ùê¢ùêßùê† [ùêô]: ‚Äú, by creating a new communication process that allowed low and medium risk tickets to be pre-appproved, reducing friction during development‚Äù

Together X + Y + Z:

‚ÄúLaunched ___ project 1 month ahead of schedule and increasing ROI by Z%, , by creating a new communication process that allowed low and medium risk tickets to be pre-appproved, reducing friction during development‚Äù

ùêÄùêúùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ùê¨ help you show that you have the experience companies look for in ùêúùê®ùêßùê≠ùêûùê±ùê≠ of a project that had impact to customers, your team or the organization.

ùêìùêöùê¢ùê•ùê®ùê´ùê¢ùêßùê† your ùêöùêúùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠ùê¨ to the job you are applying to will increase your chances of getting an interview. Adding more colors, graphs and random keywords will not.

A few extra tips as you go through your accomplishments:

1. Not every accomplishment will have a number (impact). It‚Äôs ok, try to have as many as possible.
    
2. Accomplishments tailored to the job you are applying to >>>> accomplishments you believe are the most important.
    
3. You can skip the XYZ formula and instead write them as:
    

Verb in past tense + what you did + the impact it had.

Your LinkedIn profile is NOT built for you. It's built for recruiters and hiring managers, just like your resume

- Upload a clear photo, banner, and headline.
- Use this formula for your headline:

- Add an About section with your projects, accomplishments, and skills to your profile (make them relevant to jobs you're applying to)

'Spray and pray' never worked for me. Seeing all those rejections was devastating. Instead of applying to hundreds of jobs, I decided to bring companies and recruiters to me - Here's how I did it üëá

Your LinkedIn Profile should be a 'living profile' and you should constantly experiment with it to attract recruiters to you.

[1] Understand how recruiters search for candidates

Recruiters on LinkedIn will search for keywords. These keywords should be on your profile.

They will look at your photo, your skills, your education, and your header. Optimize for this - It's your one chance to catch their attention.

[2] Tailor your profile to Job Descriptions

Job descriptions are like cheat sheets for attracting recruiters and hiring managers. Use them.

Look at many job descriptions of the job you want and look out for patterns of keywords, skills, and requirements.

Employers are telling you a detailed description of what they need. Look at the Required section and try to write as much as you can on your profile that is related to it.

[3] Update your photo. It's more important than you think.

Whether you like it or not, your photo is important and it's the first impression with anyone who wants to visit your profile, recruiters and hiring managers included.

How to have a better profile photo

- Upload your photo to¬†pfpmaker(.)com
- Select a¬†neutral color or effect that makes¬†you¬†stand out
- If you need a new photo, stand in front of a white wall. Upload it and pfpmaker will take care of the rest.

[4] Use the top banner in your profile to tell your story

Think of the banner as real estate for advertisement. Advertise yourself.

Most people either don't use the banner or have a photo of a city. This is wasting an opportunity to "sell yourself" to visitors on your Profile.

Canva has many free templates for you to use

[5] Write a headline that tells a story

Your headline is one of the most important things about your profile. Think of it this way:

- Look back at how LinkedIn Recruiter works. Your headline will be the¬†one thing¬†recruiters will read about you.
- Every time you post or comment, your headline is the¬†one thing¬†people read about who you are

Here's a template you can use to write a great headline:

[Role] | [industry or hard skills] | [Unique Value or Transferrable Skills]

[6] Write an amazing "About" section and add keywords/skills

Your About section is an opportunity to tell a story of who you are and¬†where you want to¬†go next.

This is where you can show recruiters and hiring managers that you have the skills they are looking for.

Use job descriptions of the next job(s) you want to have to look at keywords and requirements.

Bonus: Engage¬†and create content

Don't underestimate the power of commenting. A great comment can¬†generate¬†tons of new profile views!

People will see your comment ‚Üí See your Photo ‚Üí Read your header ‚Üí Click on your profile

ü§î What was something new for you from this list?

Presentation at the end of the post

3. Improve your story

Many people already have everything they need, but they share terrible stories that don't combine their experience, transferrable skills, and WHY they can be good PMs.

Your Resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and your stories (e.g., tell me about yourself) should SCREAM "PM Transferrable skills".

Here's how:

‚Üí Make a list of common PM skills

‚Üí Make a list of your experience that is relevant to those PM skills

‚Üí Write accomplishments about that experience that demonstrate that you have the skills.

‚Üí Practice every day your stories about WHY you want to be a PM and how your transferrable skills show that you can do the job.

- Search on LinkedIn for "Hiring Product Manager"
- Filter for People and companies you are interested in
- Send those who post a message with WHY you are interested and the skills you have that make you a good candidate for the role.

üöÄ Networking, networking, networking

Needless to say, I don't rely only on applying for a job. I spend as much time networking with recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn.

I focus on a key message:

‚Üí Why am I reaching out

‚Üí Which job did I apply to

‚Üí Why am I a good fit

Becoming a Product Manager is more than a certification, a resume, or a good referral.

Becoming a PM is, among other things, about

‚Üí Understanding of the role

‚Üí Improving Product Sense

‚Üí Showing you can do the job

While there are many things you need to do to become one, here's how to get started on these 3.

‚≠êÔ∏è ùóüùó≤ùóÆùóøùóªùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóÆùóØùóºùòÇùòÅ ùó£ùóøùóºùó±ùòÇùó∞ùòÅ ùó†ùóÆùóªùóÆùó¥ùó≤ùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ

Books and videos tell the general version of what is a Product Manager.

But the reality is usually different, you'll end up finding PM roles

‚ùå That are more like Project Management

‚ùå Where the roadmap is already given

‚ùå In which your job is to move tickets

‚ùå With no product to manage

Do these 3 things to learn the real Product Management

1. Define PM roles you want to explore

‚Üí What kind of PM are you interested in?

- Industry?
- Product? (B2B vs B2C)
- Type? (front-end, tech, AI...)
- Size? (startup vs. large tech)

2. Find PMs on LinkedIn that fit your list that match at least 1 of these:

- Alumni
- Transitioned similar company
- Something in common (same country)
- Are active on LinkedIn (engaged with something recently)

3. Send them a message about LEARNING. Steal this template:

"Hi [name],

My name is [name] and I'm a [your role] who is learning about Product Management.

I saw that [whatever you have in common] and see that you have an amazing career at [company].

Do you have 30 min for a coffee chat in the next few weeks?

I understand you must be very busy, so thank you for considering taking the time to share more about your journey with me!"

Finish a coffee chat by asking 2 questions:

‚Üí Anything you recommend that I do next?

‚Üí Anyone else I should reach out to learn more?

# Interviews

If I only had one weekend to prepare for a Product Manager interview, here's what I would do and how I would study üëá

‚úÖ Friday: Understand the role

If I only had 3 days to prepare, these would be my assumptions.

Focus on 2 dimensions to make a study plan.

1. Company Size
    
2. Role Level
    

Here's the detail...

1. Company Size

Depending on the Company Size, I would prioritize these topics:

Startup ‚Üí Past Experience + Industry Knowledge

Big Tech ‚Üí Past Experience + Structured Questions (e.g. how would you design X)

2. Role Level (+ = more, - = less)

APM ‚Üí ++ Product Design & Execution, + Estimation, - Strategy

PM ‚Üí ++ Product Design & execution, + Strategy

Sr. PM ‚Üí +++ All

> Sr. PM ‚Üí ++ Behavioral & Strategy, -- Product Design & Execution

‚úÖ Saturday: Creating Stories

Here's my plan for day 2 if I only had 1 weekend to prepare.

Morning ‚Üí Do Company Research and create my stories (Tell me about yourself, Why this company, etc.)

Noon ‚Üí Behavioral Questions using Amazon Leadership Principles

Afternoon ‚Üí Product Design Questions (e.g. Improve your favorite Product)

‚≠êÔ∏è Write down every answer and check how long it takes when I practice them out loud.

‚úÖ Sunday: Strategy & Execution + Practice

Morning ‚Üí Practice my stories, Behavioral Questions & Product Design

Noon ‚Üí Strategy & Execution Questions (e.g. how would you measure success of X product?)

Afternoon ‚Üí Practice everything for a while and then play videogames.

‚≠êÔ∏è Doing something fun/distracting will help you be more calm for the next day (interview day).

‚úÖ Monday: Interview Day!

The 7 most important things to remember for your interview:

1. Smile
    
2. Take time
    
3. Clarify questions
    
4. Be structured & concise
    
5. Ask questions you can't Google
    
6. Stop worrying about the thing you didn't study
    
7. HAVE FUN
    

‚≠êÔ∏è ùó¶ùóµùóÆùóøùóΩùó≤ùóªùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùòÜùóºùòÇùóø ùó£ùóøùóºùó±ùòÇùó∞ùòÅ ùó¶ùó≤ùóªùòÄùó≤

Product Sense is more than just a common interview term. It is a PM skill that is used to improve features or create new products that solve customer problems.

Spend every day doing this:

1. Choose an app (e.g., Spotify)
    
2. Choose a segment (e.g., Students)
    
3. Improve the product!
    

Get creative and think of 3 ways in which the app you chose could solve those problems for your users.

This is a simple exercise that aspiring Product Managers should do every day. It only takes 5 minutes and will 10x your Product Sense for an interview (and the job)üëá

.

.

Product Sense is more than just a buzzword. It is one of the top PM skills used to improve features or create new products that solve customer problems.

At a high level, Product Sense is composed of 3 main things:

‚Üí ùêÑùê¶ùê©ùêöùê≠ùê°ùê≤ for your users

‚Üí ùêÇùê´ùêûùêöùê≠ùê¢ùêØùê¢ùê≠ùê≤ to solve problems

‚Üí ùêÖùê•ùêûùê±ùê¢ùêõùê¢ùê•ùê¢ùê≠ùê≤ to adapt to new information

Improving Product Sense takes more than memorizing frameworks. Practicing every day for 5 minutes is a good way to build up your Product Sense muscle - here's how:

üì≤ ùêíùê≠ùêûùê© 1: ùêÇùê°ùê®ùê®ùê¨ùêû ùêö ùêèùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠

Easy ‚Üí An app you use (e.g. Spotify)

Med ‚Üí A new app you read about or from the app store

Hard ‚Üí A crowdsourced product from Kickstarter that hasn't met its funding.

üëã ùêíùê≠ùêûùê© 2: ùêÇùê°ùê®ùê®ùê¨ùêû ùêö ùê¨ùêûùê†ùê¶ùêûùêßùê≠

Easy ‚Üí Yourself (e.g., student, business professional, etc)

Med ‚Üí A relative (e.g., Grandparents, younger siblings/nieces/nephews)

Hard ‚Üí Someone who would typically won't use the app (e.g., For Spotify, choose scuba divers - while they dive)

üöÄ ùêíùê≠ùêûùê© 3: ùêàùê¶ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêØùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠!

Aim for speed and creativity, not perfection. The goal is not to develop a whole business case, but to get you used to brainstorming fast and confident - this is crucial to your interviews.

Brainstorm 3 pain points the user you chose would have - pain points about their day-to-day that the product would solve (not pain points with the product itself).

For example - if we were talking about Netflix:

‚ùå Don't: I have problems with the search function.

‚úÖ Do: I don't have time to watch long shows but want to stay updated so that I can discuss them with my friends.

Now, get creative and think of 3 ways in which the app you chose could solve those problems for your users - the crazier your ideas, the better.

Remember that the goal is to build your Product Sense muscle and get you used to brainstorming fast and confident. As you get used to this exercise you'll start to shift from [Crazy Solutions/Fast brainstorming] to [Feasible Solutions/Fast brainstorming].

As you go through this exercise remember this:

‚Üí Speed and creativity over perfection

‚Üí It's ok to start with everything on "easy"

‚Üí It'll be hard and awkward at the beginning

‚Üí When it feels like a chore, stop. Rest. Then continue.

‚Üí Practicing is 10x more effective than reading another page of a book about Product Management.

3 facts about Product Sense/Product Design Questions that most ignore and end up failing Product Management interviews üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ The framework you use doesn‚Äôt matter

‚Ä¶But make sure that you do use a framework. Product Sense/Design frameworks help you with 3 things:

- share ideas in a concise and structured way
- show that you understand how PMs approach problems
- put clarity in an ambiguous problem

I personally hate acronyms, so I follow my own STEP-by-step framework that mimics what PMs do in our day to day:

- Set a Goal to improve
- Ask questions
- Users
- Pain Points
- Features/Solutions
- Prioritization
- Metrics

‚≠êÔ∏è Frameworks are a guide, not a rigid structure for an interview - it‚Äôs ok if your framework changes as you answer a case.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Sense questions are testing for empathy

More often than not when I ask ‚Äúhow would you improve your favorite product?‚Äù, people give me a wishlist of things they want to improve for them.

But it‚Äôs never about them, it‚Äôs about improving a product (even if it‚Äôs your favorite), for a group of users of that product!

Your empathy towards users will shine in these cases when you show that

- you can think about different user segments
- you can brainstorm pain points relevant to the problem space (e.g., I don‚Äôt have time for X), and not just a problem with a product (e.g., I can‚Äôt find the button)

‚≠êÔ∏è You can practice this by taking a product (e.g., Spotify) and thinking a family member or friend (e.g., Grandparents) - now think of what problems these users may have that can be solved by the product (e.g., grandparents may not remember a song but want to listen to it, how would you design something for them?)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Creativity is VERY important

I see most people who fail a product sense/design question fall into one of two categories:

‚ùå Minimal improvements: share things like adding braille to an ATM for someone who is blind (which already exists).

‚ùå Irrelevant improvements: someone once shared that to solve the problem of ‚Äúnot having enough time‚Äù, we should ask users to spend more time giving us data to then personalize.

Creativity is not about inventing the next ‚ÄúX‚Äù to solve all the problems in the world through an app.

‚≠êÔ∏è In my interviews, I show creativity by sharing at least 3 solutions:

1. An incremental feature: a new way to do X through the same product
    
2. A feature that adds more technology (like AI&ML) and uses other parts of the product/platform/ecosystem
    
3. A feature that may not be feasible today (moonshot idea).
    

‚Äî‚Äî-

These are 3 questions you'll see in EVERY Product Management interview and the framework to ACE themüëá

1. "Tell me about yourself"

They care about ‚Üí

Interviewers want to learn about the skills you've learned throughout your career that are RELEVANT to the job you are interviewing for.

Your Goal ‚Üí

Make your story as relevant to the job as possible.

Framework:

START ‚Üí SKILLS ‚Üí TRANSITION ‚Üí SKILLS... ‚Üí TRANSITION ‚Üí CONCLUSION

START ‚Üí Begin your story with your school/early job.

SKILLS ‚Üí Talk about the skills that learned there, RELEVANT to the job interview

TRANSITION ‚Üí In the transition to the next job/school, talk about WHY you wanted to change to the next job (e.g., learn new skills)

...then repeat...

SKILLS ‚Üí TRANSITION ‚Üí SKILLS...

CONCLUSION ‚Üí finish your story by telling your interviewer by giving 1 or 2 reasons why you want to join their company.

2. "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with Engineers"

They care about ‚Üí

PMs work with engineers all the time. They want to see how you handle conflicts and whether you'd be a good fit for the team.

Your Goal ‚Üí

Show that you have empathy, are a team player, and understand how to work with Engineers. Talk about a past experience.

Framework:

Situation ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Lesson (STAR+L)

Situation ‚Üí Context of your story. When did it happen and who were the people involved in the situation?

Task ‚Üí Why did the conflict happen?

Action ‚Üí What were the steps YOU took to handle the conflict?

Results ‚Üí What was the outcome?

Lesson ‚Üí What did you learn during this conflict that you'll now use whenever there's any new conflict happening?

3. "How would you improve X (e.g. your favorite) Product?"

They care about ‚Üí

They want to see how you break down problems and solve them as a Product Manager would solve them.

Your Goal ‚Üí

Solve the problem by following most/all the steps in a product development cycle, from ideation all the way to launch it.

My STEP Framework:

Questions ‚Üí GOAL ‚Üí USERS ‚Üí PAIN POINTS ‚Üí FEATURES ‚Üí PRIORITIZATION ‚Üí METRICS

Questions ‚Üí Ask questions to narrow down the problem

GOAL ‚Üí Why are you improving the product? Have a goal like increasing the number of users.

USERS ‚Üí List 3 segments and choose one. Use characteristics like "Student" or "Parent" to select your segments.

PAIN POINTS ‚Üí For the user you chose, think of 3 pain points they would have.

FEATURES ‚Üí Put on your PM hat, how would you solve those pain points? Have at least 1 moonshot idea.

PRIORITIZATION ‚Üí Prioritize the features you chose. In an interview use a simple framework like Impact, Effort, and Urgency (e.g. competitor advantage)

METRICS ‚Üí Talk about North Star (your GOAL) & Signposts (metrics related to your features)

3. Improve your story

Many people already have everything they need, but they share terrible stories that don't combine their experience, transferrable skills, and WHY they can be good PMs.

Your Resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and your stories (e.g., tell me about yourself) should SCREAM "PM Transferrable skills".

Here's how:

‚Üí Make a list of common PM skills

‚Üí Make a list of your experience that is relevant to those PM skills

‚Üí Write accomplishments about that experience that demonstrate that you have the skills.

‚Üí Practice every day your stories about WHY you want to be a PM and how your transferrable skills show that you can do the job.

Product Manager interviews are much more than memorizing frameworks. These are 5 things I always do before an interview that helps me land offers!üëá

"Tell me about yourself" is not about summarizing your resume.

Instead, I focus on connecting my story to what is relevant to the job I'm interviewing for. Ask yourself these questions:

‚Üí Why are you interested in this position?

‚Üí What skills did you learn in previous jobs that are RELEVANT to the interview?

‚≠êÔ∏è Make your story RELEVANT to the interview.

I interviewed with Microsoft in 2019 for an AI&ML PM role for which I didn't have a Data Science or ML background.

I knew I was going to get questions about this.

I made a plan:

I created answers that convinced my interviewer that...

‚Üí I had all the experience required to be a PM on their team

‚Üí I can learn fast and I already made a plan to take courses to ramp up in AI/ML skills

Never jump into answering questions right away, especially product case questions.

Instead:

‚Üí Always ask for time

‚Üí Repeat the question back

‚Üí Clarify questions about cases

‚Üí Make every answer a conversation with your interviewer

‚≠êÔ∏è Most people I interview jump straight into answering the question without thinking about it. Their answers tend to be confusing, going in circles and overall unstructured - they are hard to follow.

PM skills are not just assessed through Product Case Questions.

IFocus on my communication in the interview:

‚Üí Concise & Structured answers

‚Üí Make the interview a dialogue

‚Üí Ask for the interviewer's opinion

‚Üí Show empathy for others through stories

‚≠êÔ∏è You may know all the frameworks in the world, but if you can't clearly show your thought process to arrive to an answer, it's likely that you won't pass that interview.

Never underestimate the power of a smile üòÅ

Product Management interviews are NOT about finding the best frameworks. The frameworks you choose don't matter - Instead, here's what will get you an offerüëá

Product Management interviews are much more than just frameworks.

Landing a Product Manager offer is about showing...

‚Üí Good communication

‚Üí Transferrable skills

‚Üí Actions you took

ùêáùê®ùê∞ ùê≠ùê® ùê¶ùêöùê§ùêû ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùê¨ùê≠ùê®ùê´ùê¢ùêûùê¨ ùê¨ùê≠ùêöùêßùêù ùê®ùêÆùê≠

‚≠êÔ∏è Good communication

It's about being concise and structured in your answers. Take time to write down a few points after you hear a question to help you guide the conversation.

Those who don't communicate effectively, repeat the same point repeatedly, and their stories typically don't answer the question they were asked.

You'd be surprised at how common this is.

‚≠êÔ∏è Transferrable Skills

I'm sure you've done some fantastic things in your career, but not everything will be related to the job you are interviewing for.

Tailor your stories like "Tell me about yourself" to talk about RELEVANT skills. You can use the job description and networking with people on the team to learn more about which skills are the most relevant.

‚≠êÔ∏è YOUR actions

In any interview, you'll come across questions like "Tell me about a time when..." and interviewers want to hear about what YOU did.

More often than not, I've heard stories about "a conflict in the team" where candidates summarize solving the conflict as "... and we spoke about the issue and resolved it".

As you go through your stories, share many more "I" than "We".

ùêáùê®ùê∞ ùê≠ùê® ùê¶ùêöùê§ùêû ùê≤ùê®ùêÆùê´ ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠ ùêùùêûùê¨ùê¢ùê†ùêß (ùêöùêßùêù ùê®ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê´ ùêúùêöùê¨ùêûùê¨) ùê¨ùê≠ùêöùêßùêù ùê®ùêÆùê≠:

üöÄ Talk about Customers

Improving products, even your favorite ones is NEVER about what YOU think should be improved.

Instead, always talk about the goal of improving a product and which customers/users you are improving it for.

üöÄ Share your process to solve the problem

Interviewers don't care about the name of the framework, but they want to see how you plan on approaching the problem.

Walk them through your thought process and how you plan to approach the problem before jumping into a solution.

üöÄ Make it a dialogue

Interviews are not about you rushing through cases. Pause every few steps to ask your interviewer if they have any questions or if there's anything else you should consider.

Making interviews a dialogue contributes to showing good communication.

Preparing for Product Management interviews feels like taking a full-time job. Luckily, these 5 questions are the most common ones, and here's how I prepare for themüëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Tell me about yourself.

Keep it relevant to the job by summarizing your experience and the skills you acquired that relate to the role.

Here's a simple framework to follow:

‚Üí Start with your early experiences and skills you learned RELEVANT to the job

‚Üí Why did you transition to your next role/job?

‚Üí What RELEVANT skills did you learn on that job?

‚Üí Why did you transition again?

... repeat...

‚Üí Now, why are you here in this interview?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Product Management?

This will be a common question if you are an aspiring Product Manager.

‚Üí Show your understanding of the role, why you want to pursue it, and how you have the skills needed.

‚Üí Make it personal to you. "...because I want to help build products that impact people's lives" is the most generic thing in the world. Why do YOU want to be a PM?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Can you tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with your Engineering team?

They want to assess how you handle teams and conflicts within them. Especially

‚Üí Use the S.T.A.R.L. formula to explain the situation, task, action, result, and lesson learned.

Situation ‚Üí Give the context of what happened

Task ‚Üí What was the conflict?

Action ‚Üí Share what YOU did. Use "I" >>> "we"

Results ‚Üí What happened at the end?

Lesson ‚Üí What did you learn that you'll use always when dealing with conflicts?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Product Design (e.g. Improve your favorite product.)

No PM interview would be complete without a Product Design question. Interviewers don't care about the name of the framework you use, they care that you use one to make a short, clear, and concise answer.

‚Üí Use my STEP framework to explain goals, users, pain points, solutions, prioritization, and metrics.

‚Üí Make it a dialogue and work with your interviewer on the case.

‚Üí Take as much time as you need to brainstorm.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Product Execution (e.g., Your product metrics are down 15%, what do you do?)

Believe it or not, this happens in every organization. When they ask you these questions it's based on a real scenario.

‚Üí Show how you assess the situation, conduct root cause analysis, and factor in internal and external factors.

‚Üí There is no right answer, but a wrong answer is one where you only consider a single factor like "let's assume we recently released something so let's just explore that"

I have done 500+ mock interviews and these are the top 3 things they do that stops them from getting an offerüëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Not sharing experience relevant to the job

Interviewers are trying to assess whether you‚Äôd be a great fit for the role and the team. A lot of people share accomplishments and stories that show great impact‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not as relevant to the role they are interviewing for.

For example, I‚Äôve coached PMs who apply to customer facing PM roles - they have had great impact in their teams, but in their stories they never talk about customers, or involving engineering in their decision making process.

‚≠êÔ∏è Share stories that highlight your skills relevant to the job you are interviewing for. Don‚Äôt focus only on the impact of your accomplishment.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Not understanding that frameworks are tools

Many interviewees (aspiring and experienced PMs) obsess about making sure they don‚Äôt miss a single step in a framework, especially when the framework is an acronym.

Most of them fear that they will fail an interview because they didn‚Äôt prioritized this or that, or that they will fail because the question is slightly different from what they practiced and they try to force the framework into the answer.

In reality, frameworks are tools that you should use to help you in an interview - what‚Äôs more important is to understand what‚Äôs behind the framework - next time you are practicing for interviews, ask yourself these questions:

- why do we have to choose a goal?
- why are we segmenting users?
- why do we prioritize this over that?
- ‚Ä¶ question every step of the framework.

Which framework you use doesn‚Äôt matter as long as it reflects what PMs do in our day to day

‚≠êÔ∏è Don‚Äôt obsess about making a framework fit an answer. Instead, see it as a tool that is flexible - it‚Äôs more important to show how you are thinking the answer than the specific framework you use.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Not being concise and structured

Sharing stories in an interview is not an easy task. You are trying to consolidate months or years of experience in 3~5 minutes.

The stories that become irrelevant in an interview share the same things:

- too much about the context, too little about what you did
- going in circles in the story without structure
- not going deep enough into the story (share what you did in detail, not just ‚ÄúI worked with X to solve the problem‚Äù)

You can be a great fit for a role and team, but if you don‚Äôt share enough evidence with them that you can do the job, they may not be willing to extend an offer.

‚≠êÔ∏è if you use STAR framework, spend most of your time going in detail on the Action part of it.

Hi Happy Friday ‚úåÔ∏è Here's your reminder that expensive certificates and cohorts are not the key to getting a product manager offer.

So what is? Here's 3 things I tell all my mentees üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Reduce noise

There's no perfect framework. There is no magic formula. There are no secrets in the interview process.

Either you can solve cases like a Product Manager would act in our day-to-day, or you can't. Pick a framework that you understand, makes sense to you, and that has been validated _recently_ by others (including the instructor).

You'll always read about the new "This is the ultimate guide to crack X interview"... It's the same thing repackaged, spend more time practicing and preparing than looking for that perfect guide.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Practice, by yourself or with someone, but practice

Don't have anyone to practice with?

‚Üí Record yourself and evaluate your own performance

‚Üí Join free discord/slack groups to find partners

‚Üí In my opinion, when you exhaust free options then pay for mock interviews

Here's what I believe is the most effective thing to do that almost no one does:

Offer your time to interview others. Why?

‚Üí The more you listen to others, the easier it'll be to get used to identifying good vs bad answers, seeing what frameworks others use, and observing whether their structure and communication are good.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sometimes how you communicate is the problem, not your framework

Good communication in your interview is about structure and conciseness. A lot of people I've heard in a mock interview make the same mistakes:

‚Üí Repeating the same point over and over

‚Üí Making the case/story too complicated to follow by treating their story as one long sentence.

‚Üí Not talking about what the interviewer cares about. For example: If you are going for Sr/Principal (or above) PM levels, talk about skills related to that new level

Great communication can be about

‚≠êÔ∏è Separate ideas with "first", "Next", "Then", and do a summary every now and then "so, in short, there are the 3 things that..."

‚≠êÔ∏è Go deep into what you accomplished and reduce the context. Interviewers may not need to know the specifics of the project you are working on like how many features it has, but they want to know the things you accomplished in the project - they care about your story, not about your product

‚≠êÔ∏è Make your stories relevant. Talk about skills and experiences related to the job you are interviewing for - that's what your interviewer cares about.

These are the top 3 mistakes I see all the time that people make in their Product Management interviews + how to fix them! üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Your stories don't match the job you are interviewing for

Understanding the role and expectations before your interview is key to creating stories that show you can do the job. I've seen plenty of PMs interviewing for Sr. PM roles who focus all the stories on execution and don't talk about working on the strategy or vision for their features/product - which is expected.

For example, when interviewing for a Sr. PM role, don't just talk about how you executed a project. Instead, talk about how you worked on developing the strategy of it.

Your stories should be tailored to the role that you are interviewing for:

APM & PM ‚Üí Execution

Sr. PM ‚Üí Execution + Strategy/Vision

Principal PM ‚Üí Strategy/Vision + Owning a Problem Space + Mentoring

PM Manager ‚Üí All above + Managing PMs

2Ô∏è‚É£ You are not sharing enough about what you accomplished

Interviewers ask you behavioral questions like "Tell me about a time when..." to understand (a) how you have dealt with situations like that in the past and (b) how you would deal with situations you would encounter on the new job.

Most people share stories centered around the outcome and not what they did to achieve that outcome. For example, when asking a question like "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with someone on the team", they tend to limit their answer to explaining:

‚Üí The situation

‚Üí They heard the other person and found the middle ground

‚Üí Achieved a positive outcome

Solving a conflict goes beyond listening and finding a middle ground. Perhaps in your story you...

‚Üí Understood their concerns

‚Üí Looked for data to build a case

‚Üí Prepared a plan and sought approval

‚Üí Repriotizied projects

Be thorough in your stories and share details about what YOU did to accomplish a great outcome.

3Ô∏è‚É£ You force a framework into an answer

Frameworks for PM interviews are meant to be a guide on how to solve interview questions. However, many make the mistake of trying to put a framework into every question they are asked.

Interviewers don't care about which framework you use, they care that you understand how to solve the question by thinking like a Product Manager; i.e., what you would do on the job to solve that question.

Sometimes you'll use half of a framework you know and other times you'll use more steps than the acronym you memorized.

‚Üí Ask for time to think about the question

‚Üí Ask clarifying questions to narrow down the problem

‚Üí Break the problem into steps

‚Üí Think about your users

‚Üí Be concise, clear and avoid rambling in your solution

üíé Succeeding in your interviews requires a combination of:

‚Üí Doing a lot of research

‚Üí Practicing as much as you can

‚Üí Understanding WHY we use frameworks instead of just memorizing them

Messages like this make my day! In the middle of this "crazy market", Product Managers and aspiring PMs that go through my course are getting multiple offers from top companies. ùêáùêûùê´ùêû'ùê¨ ùê°ùê®ùê∞ ùê≠ùê® ùê©ùê´ùêûùê©ùêöùê´ùêû ùêüùê®ùê´ ùêèùêå ùê¢ùêßùê≠ùêûùê´ùêØùê¢ùêûùê∞ùê¨üëá

The most important things about preparing for your Product Management interviews are understanding:

‚Üí How to allocate your time to learn

‚Üí Key areas/questions to focus on

‚Üí Which frameworks to study

Here's how I spend my time before an interview:

‚≠êÔ∏è 5% Researching

Spend time researching the company's products, culture, and anything you can see on social media about them. This research will help you create your stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è 10% Your Story

Spend this time on answers to

‚Üí Tell me about yourself

‚Üí Why do you want to join this company?

‚Üí Why Product Management (for aspiring PMs)

‚≠êÔ∏è 20% Behavioral questions (S.T.A.R.+L.)

Work on your stories to highlight transferrable skills to the job you are interviewing for.

üü¢ Use this STAR+L framework:

Situation ‚Üí What/where/when happened?

Task ‚Üí What was the problem/task?

Action ‚Üí What did YOU do to solve it?

Results ‚Üí What was the outcome?

Lesson ‚Üí What did you learn from this? (related to transferrable skills)

‚≠êÔ∏è 40% Product Design/Sense/Case questions

Practice these 3 types of problems:

‚Üí Improve your Favorite product

‚Üí Improve an app (something not very popular)

‚Üí Improve a non-tech product

üöÄ Add a moonshot to your ideas

üü¢ My STEP framework:

‚Üí Ask questions

‚Üí Share a GOAL

‚Üí Users (3) - pick 1

‚Üí Painpoints (3)

‚Üí Solutions (3)

‚Üí Prioritize solutions

‚Üí Metrics for success

(quick recap at the end)

‚≠êÔ∏è 15% Strategy

Practice:

Hypothetical ‚Üí "Should HBO make video games?"

Historical ‚Üí "Why did Microsoft acquire LinkedIn?"

üü¢ Use a mix of two frameworks:

‚Üí 3Cs: Customers, Company, Competitors

‚Üí Porter's 5 forces

‚≠êÔ∏è 10% Execution & Estimation

Execution questions are about the day-to-day of Product Managers, usually involving metrics

‚Üí Metric changes: "X metric is down 15%, why?"

‚Üí Measuring success: "How would you measure the success of X new feature?"

Estimation questions are about market sizing with a top-down or bottom-up approach:

‚Üí "How much revenue does YouTube generate per day?"

üü¢ The frameworks to use:

Changes ‚Üí Exhaustive list of all possible scenarios: External factors, internal, etc.

Success ‚Üí North Star (the Goal of the feature), Signposts (proof that you moved the NorthStar), Guardrails (don't harm the business - e.g., track revenue, subscriptions, etc.)

Estimation ‚Üí Start broad (e.g. # users in a country) and narrow down to specifics (e.g., Avg. time watched / person)

üíé

‚Üí Choose practicing > learning one more anything

‚Üí If you don't have anyone to practice with, record yourself

Here‚Äôs how I prepare for Behavioral interview questions that helped me land jobs at places like Microsoft, LinkedIn, Zillow and PayPal.

All of your product management (or any other role) interviews will have behavioral questions like ‚Äútell me about a time that you had a conflict with X‚Äù

Most people focus on the wrong things to ‚Äúace‚Äù these interviews:

‚ùå Improvising to ‚Äúnot sound like a robot‚Äù

‚ùå Not spending enough time on the details of what they did and how they did it

‚ùå Worrying too much about providing all the context and metrics, instead of their accomplishments

Instead, here are the things I work on to ace my behavioral interviewsüëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pick a simple framework

Pick a simple framework that gives you an opportunity to highlight your accomplishments.

Situation - explained what happened

Task - what was your role within the context of the situation (e.g., Why was there a conflict? Why did you need to make that decision?)

Action - spend most of your time here, describe what YOU did, but recognize your team‚Äôs effort. 90% ‚ÄúI did‚Äù, 10% ‚Äúwe did‚Äù

Results - what was the outcome? Very ok if you don‚Äôt have numbers

Lesson - what did you learn from this that will apply to the next situation?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Give more details of what you did

During mock interviews I usually ask ‚Äútell me about a conflict you had‚Äù and most people answer something like:

- had a conflict with X
- decided to talk with them, understand where they are coming from and find middle ground
- now we work well

But conflicts are almost never solved like this conflicts have plenty of ambiguity:

- what data did you show?
- what were their and your priorities? Why didn‚Äôt they match?
- convincing someone doesn‚Äôt take one meeting, what was all the back and forth about?

Go into as many details as you can about what YOU did

3Ô∏è‚É£ Answer the question

I know, sounds obvious! You‚Äôd be surprised at how many don‚Äôt answer the question they get in the interview.

If the question is about‚Ä¶

- a conflict, share WHY was it a conflict and WHY was it important to solve it
- a time you failed, share WHY was it a failure and what did you learn from it
- dealing with a tough customer, share WHAT made it difficult and HOW did you helped your customer

It‚Äôs very ok to ask for time to write down the question and think about your answer before sharing it.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Other quick tips

- memorize the main concepts of your story, not every word. This will help you not sound like a robot.
- have enough stories. It‚Äôs ok to repurpose a story for different answers, but don‚Äôt share the same one with all your interviewers.
- neither too short nor too long. Have stories that last 4~5 minutes. Under 3 you probably missed details and over 6 you probably are sharing irrelevant details
- make it relevant. Interviewing for product management? Share product management relevant skills and experiences in your stories.

This is the framework that I use to answer Product Design questions in PM interviews, and why it is the best one üëá

These questions can come in the form of:

- new products: ‚ÄúHow would you design a a new alarm clock for a blind person?‚Äù
- improving products: ‚ÄúHow would you improve your favorite product?‚Äù

The framework I use and teach is called the STEP framework because it follows a series of logical steps that mimic what PMs do in our day to day.

üîµ STEP Framework üîµ

These are the steps:

- Clarifying questions
- Goal
- Users
- Pain Points
- Features
- Prioritization
- Metrics

Let‚Äôs dive into them:

üîπ Clarifying questions

These should help you narrow down the scope of the problem. You can always ask:

- Which company are we?
- Are there any constraints?

If they ask you ‚Äúdesign a new product for a kitchen‚Äù you can ask ‚Äúis this a kitchen for homes, schools, hospitals or somewhere else?‚Äù

Narrow down the scope.

üîπ GOAL

The goal is the main pillar of your case. All the products and features are tied to goals, and goals are tied to metrics.

For example, a Goal can be to increase number of users, or increase engagement.

On the job you‚Äôll have different goals, in an interview pick one.

üîπ Users

Pick 3 users, and don‚Äôt classify them by age or expertise (e.g., men 25-35 years old who are experts on the product).

Instead, think of users based on their characteristics like: young professional who enjoyed traveling.

It‚Äôs easier to brainstorm pain points for the latter.

üîπ Pain Points

Products and features are not built because ‚Äúthey would be cool‚Äù.

Brainstorm 3 pain points related to the problem space, not with the product. For example, if you were to improve Spotify think of problems that fans may have related to listening to their favorite artists, not problems with a Spotify feature.

üîπSolutions

Your solutions should meet this criteria:

- Aligned with the Goal
- Should solve all pain points
- Ideally, have one moonshot idea
- Aligned with the company‚Äôs strategy

To that last point, your ideas should ‚Äòmake sense‚Äô with the company. For example, ‚Äòlowering prices‚Äô or ‚Äòbuilding kitchen products‚Äô would not go very well with improving something for Apple - they are all about premium and ecosystem.

üîπ Prioritizing

Prioritizing on the job is never easy. There‚Äôs data that you need, input from many stakeholders, customer feedback, etc.

In an interview, we can use at least two variables:

- impact (to the Goal)
- effort

For each feature choose Low/Med/High for these variables and rank the features.

üîπMetrics

There are three levels of metrics you should consider in an interview:

- North Star: your Goal
- Signposts: metrics that show that your feature contributed to the Goal (e.g., for a video feature you‚Äôll measure ‚Äúavg. watch time‚Äù)
- Guardrails: metrics that protect the business like ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù

These at 3 things I do in my PM interviews that make a world of difference to the interviewer and lands me offers üëá

I believe that getting an offer after an interview is a combination of 2 things:

- Context: how well you understand the role and their company/product/industry
- Execution: how you deliver your message in every question they ask

I‚Äôll focus on the execution, which is where most people I coach (and interview) fail.

üîµ Take time to brainstorm

After the interviewer finishes asking their question, most people tend to jump into answering right away - this is, in most cases, a bad idea‚Ä¶ why?

The mix of being nervous and adrenaline will usually have you ramble and repeat your point 10 times, or not being thorough enough.

Your goal in any interview should be to give clear, concise and structured answers. Asking for time to brainstorm will give you that. All you have to do is ask ‚Äúis it ok if I take a few seconds to write a few things down?‚Äù

You might think that asking for time sounds obvious, but you‚Äôd be surprised at how few actually do it in an interview.

üü¢Lead the interview with a dialogue

I always try to make my interviews ‚Äúeasier‚Äù by leading them instead of waiting for follow-up questions.

How does this work?

Let‚Äôs say that your interviewer asks you a question like: how would you design X product? (The question doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is that there will be follow up questions).

To lead the interview you need a solid framework foundation.

After you finish answering one part of your case (e.g., talking about users), instead of waiting for the interviewer to ask you anything else they can think of, you can simply tell them something like this:

‚ÄúOk, we just talked about users, what I‚Äôd like to do next is talk about Pain Points. Before I do that, do you have any questions?‚Äù

This has three effects:

1 - you lead by telling what you‚Äôll do next

2 - you make it a dialogue by asking questions

3 - you do a quick recap of the case

Leading the case leads to more predictability.

üü† Tie your stories to Why? Why now? For whom? and How?

Most people I interview know the basic prompts like ‚Äúhow would you improve X?‚Äù, but when they get thrown a curveball like ‚Äúhow do you monetize X?‚Äù They freeze.

PMs don‚Äôt find a completely new approach to each problem they try to solve.

The things that PMs do are tied to:

- Goals (why?)
- Users (for whom?)
- Pain Points (why now?)
- Features to solve them (How?)

There are more things but to keep it simple, I focus on those questions above.

Your interviews are a reflection of the job and if you are able to communicate how you tie that question to how PMs solve problems then you are ready for any curveball they throw at you.

Frameworks are there to guide you, understand how and why they work, not just memorize a series of steps for a specific problem.

This is exactly what I do to impress my interviewers in the first five minutes of all my interviews üëá

In most of your interviews you‚Äôll be asked the same question in the first 5 minutes: ‚Äútell me about yourself‚Äù (can also be asked as ‚Äúwalk me through your resume‚Äù)

Your interviewers are interested in knowing WHY you are a good fit for the role and the culture of the company

Most candidates I‚Äôve interviewed and coached make the same mistakes:

‚ùå Explain more about their companies and responsibilities than skills they learned relevant to the interview

‚ùå Make a very long introduction of more than 5 minutes

‚ùå Add STAR stories in their intro (taking more time)

My ‚Äútell me about yourself‚Äù follows these principles:

‚úÖ Structured and concise

‚úÖ RELEVANT to the job I‚Äôm interviewing for

I use a simple and repeatable structure - each job/transition I make is like a Lego block that stacks onto each other. In other words, everything is connected

Framework:

üü† Introduction

üîµ Job and company (skills learned)

üü¢ Transition to next job/school

üîµ other Job and company

üü¢ Transition‚Ä¶

üîµüü¢üîµüü¢‚Ä¶

üü° Why do I want to work with them?

üü† Introduction: this is where I connect who am I with why I‚Äôm excited about the company.

For example, if I were interviewing with a company like Reddit and communities were important in my life, I would share that: ‚ÄúHi! My name is Diego and communities have always been important in my life because‚Ä¶.‚Äù Wrap up quickly and transition to the next part.

üîµ Job and company: I usually start from my first job. As time passes, I spend less time talking about my first couple of jobs to the point where I could mention in general two or three things I learned and move on to more recent jobs.

Think of stacking legos where the height represents the amount of time you speak about them. At the bottom (early career) you‚Äôll have flat pieces and as you stack them (more recent jobs) you‚Äôll grab taller pieces.

The most important thing about each job you mention is that you need to talk about skills that you learn that are RELEVANT to the job you interview for.

When I was an aspiring PM I would say something like this: ‚ÄúI used to work in a Business Intelligence consulting firm where I learned about working with customers, work with engineers, (skill 3), (skill4)‚Ä¶.‚Äù

üü¢ Transitions: tie your transitions to a reason that shows growth. For example, maybe you moved from one job to the next because you wanted to learn about a new industry or a new skill that shows you are a good fit for the role.

For example: ‚Äúafter X years of doing this job, I realized that I wanted to learn more about Y industry (or grow in Z other position/skills), so I joined X2‚Äù

Make sure that your story is ~3 minutes at the most and remember to make it as relevant as possible to the job you are interviewing for!

This is how you can stand out in your interviews and get an offer. It sounds simple, but most people fail at it üëá

Standing out in your interviews has nothing to do with:

- Frameworks
- Impresive success metrics
- Knowing 'everything' about the company

Standing out is all about Storytelling:

- Structure
- Relevance
- Depth

Let's get into the details of each one:

There are many frameworks to structure your answers, like the S.T.A.R. + Lesson one. However, structure has nothing to do with which framework you use.

Structure helps you communicate effectively, but memorizing word by word makes you sound like a robot.

Structure is about 3 things:

- Concise... i.e., get to the point!
- Organized... when you describe actions talk in lists (first I did..., then I went, next I...)
- About you... Less about the context and more time about what YOU did

Structure is the backbone of your entire story.

You might have incredible accomplishments, but if they are not ùê´ùêûùê•ùêûùêØùêöùêßùê≠ to the job you are interviewing for, they will be less impactful than you think.

Being relevant in your stories is showing that you:

- Understand the job really well and
- You can do the job really well

For example, in a PM interview when you talk about finding data to solve a customer problem, focus less on how you found the data, complexity of systems or query you used, the technical constraints or how you presented the data. Instead, focus more on:

- Why did the customer had that problem?
- How did you use the data to help you arrive to a decision? (mention a few technical things)
- How did you use your findings to convince others?
- How did solving that problem contributed to the team/company?

Your stories are built for your interviewers, not for you. Your greatest accomplishment might not be that great if it's not relevant to the job you are interviewing for.

Depth is all about giving enough evidence to support your stories and show that you can do the job.

When I ask people a question like "Tell me about a time you had a conflict" their story can be summarized as:

- Too much context about the company, product or people involved
- A very short section where they understood the other person, sat down to chat and 'understood where they are coming from'
- All is good now, learned about empathy

Interviewers don't ask these questions to see whether you've had conflicts in the past (or any question they ask). They want to learn HOW you approach these situations - A conflict is not solved, in most cases, by just having 1 conversation. If you've had a conflict you probably...

- Understood the 'WHY?' behind the other person's opinion
- Gather information and data that would help you build a case
- Presented your case/solution to convince them

Share a lot more about what you did and how you did it, and less about the context of the situation.

# Take home assignments:

More and more companies are asking for a take-home assignment in their interview process. Here‚Äôs how to master them üëá

Take home assignments are a case study that reflects a business problem relevant to the industry and role you are interviewing for - companies will usually ask you to create a presentation that you‚Äôll show to a panel.

They are trying to answer three key questions:

- Do you understand Product Management?
- Do you have good communication skills?
- Can you empathize with our users and our business?

However, it‚Äôs very easy to get distracted and focus on the things that matter the least to your interviewers:

‚ùå Which colors and template you use

‚ùå A long introduction about the case, mission, vision and history of the company

‚ùå Graphics, pictures, videos and animated slides

Instead, here are 4 things to focus on that will actually help you impress your interviewers üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Concise and to the point

Don‚Äôt overcrowd your slides with text trying to explain every single detail.

- Use bullet points with short ideas. Speak to explain these points further
- If you use tables, highlight what you want your audience to see
- Leverage the appendix for ‚Äòheavy‚Äô slides. Use the main slides for summaries, abstracts and concise ideas

Your presentation should be a guide for your audience to follow your story, not a book to read while you speak about it.

2Ô∏è‚É£ So what?

Every slide in your story should have a ‚Äúso what?‚Äù.

In other words, there has to be a reason for that slide - for example:

- connecting two ideas
- narrowing down a problem
- moving from general to specifics
- explaining a concept in a previous slide
- etc‚Ä¶

Slides that are not connected or that don‚Äôt explain anything only contribute to noise and confusion in your presentation.

Another way to think about it is: what is the takeaway from each slide?

3Ô∏è‚É£ Time is your worst enemy

I‚Äôve seen presentations with 40 slides for a 20 min presentation.

Divide the time you have for your interview -5 minutes for introductions and questions. Then divide that time by the number of slides you have‚Ä¶ probably not much time left per slide.

For example:

30 min to present - 5 min for intro/questions = 25 min

20 slides = 25min/20 slides = 1 min 15 seconds per slide or in other words‚Ä¶ not a lot of time!

Be concise and to the point.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Make assumptions

Most people get stuck when they read the prompt because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have data to solve this‚Äù‚Ä¶ and you won‚Äôt!

Companies won‚Äôt evaluate whether you got the right data or whether you found information on Reddit. They‚Äôll evaluate your ability to communicate a story that answers their questions from the case.

Make assumptions, share them and solve the case!
