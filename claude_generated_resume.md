I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about a job description, your professional background, or best practices for job applications that you may have intended to provide. Without these details, I can't generate a tailored resume that accurately reflects your qualifications and matches them to a specific job.

To create a customized resume, I would need:

1. The full job description for the product manager position you're applying to.
2. Your detailed professional background, including your work history, education, skills, and any relevant achievements.
3. Any specific best practices or guidelines you want to follow for this job application.

If you can provide this information, I'd be happy to help you create a tailored resume in the format you've requested. The structure you've outlined (Contact Information, Work Experience, Education, Skills, and Additional Sections) is a solid framework for a professional resume.

Once you have these details ready, please share them, and I'll assist you in crafting a resume that highlights your most relevant experiences and skills for the product manager position.
